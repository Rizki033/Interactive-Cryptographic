# RC4 Cipher GUI

This project provides a graphical interface (Tkinter) for encrypting and decrypting messages using the **RC4 stream cipher**.  

In addition to encryption and decryption, the application measures and displays real-time **performance metrics**, including:  
- Execution time (ms)  
- CPU usage (%)  
- Memory consumption (MB)  

The application also features **interactive performance graphs** using Matplotlib, allowing users to visualize:  
- Execution time per operation  
- CPU usage per operation  
- Dynamic chart types (Bars, Lines, Area)  
- Colored bars for better readability  

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages with RC4  
- Measure and display CPU, memory, and execution time  
- Graphical representation of performance metrics  
- Choice of graph type (Bar, Line, Area)  
- Clear stats and results easily  
- Multi-threaded execution for smooth GUI
