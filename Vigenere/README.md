# Vigenère Cipher

This repository contains a clean and efficient implementation of the Vigenère Cipher, a classical polyalphabetic substitution cipher widely used before modern cryptography.
The algorithm uses a repeating keyword to encrypt and decrypt alphabetic messages using modular arithmetic.
