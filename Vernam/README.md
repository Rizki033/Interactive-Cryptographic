# Vernam Cipher (One-Time Pad)
The Vernam Cipher, invented in 1917 by Gilbert Vernam, is a symmetric encryption algorithm based on the XOR operation.
When the key is perfectly random, as long as the message, and used only once, the system becomes a One-Time Pad (OTP)  the only cipher proven to be unbreakable.
